### HiðŸ‘‹ everyone, I'm Denys Shchyptsov

I am a Junior Full-Stack Developer. I have some knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React and Node.js. I strive to become a part of a successful constantly developing company that creates cool projects. I am very creative, constantly learning, and always trying to improve my skills. 
I am a purposeful team player, stress-resistant and sociable. That is why teamwork makes great sense to me. I appreciate co-working with professional developers who eagerly adopt experience. I am always ready to help in all working processes for successful project completion.

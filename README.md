### HiðŸ‘‹ everyone, I'm Denys Shchyptsov

I am a Junior Full-Stack Developer. I have some knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React and Node.js. I strive to become a part of a successful constantly developing company that creates cool projects. I am very creative, constantly learning, and always trying to improve my skills.
